pepper asks you if you really want him to go to youtube, it waits for a yes or no answer.
then it rick rolls you and asks you again if you really want to go to youtube waiting for a yes or no answer

if you say yes, it makes another joke but it will launch youtube with gunther-ding dong song video. You can interact with youtube. 
it will keep youtube open until you either say "Close Youtube" or "Stop Youtube".

if you say no it will leave the behaviour.
